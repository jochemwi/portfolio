# Data Scientist

### Education
BSc Health Technology,
MSc Data Science for Food and Health, 

### Work Experience
Student Assistant â€“ Data Engineer for AI-Based Crop Modeling - Artificial Intelligence Group, Wageningen University
- As a student assistant for the new AI Group at Wageningen University, I developed ETL data pipelines to process open-access crop datasets
- Focused on automating data extraction, cleaning, and validation for use in crop modeling  studies with APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator)
- Ensured data accuracy and consistency through structured preprocessing, enabling efficient downstream analysis and reproducible research workflows

### Projects
Exploring Techniques to Identify Commonly Consumed Dishes in the Netherlands: A Data Science Approach - for the RIVM (Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment)
- Applied Association Rule Mining to discover patterns and relationships in dietary data
- Identified frequently co-occurring dishes to better understand Dutch eating habits
- Leveraged data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and pattern discovery techniques for actionable insights in food consumption research

Nutritional Insights into COVID-19 Mortality: A Data-Driven Approach
- Analyzed the relationship between national dietary patterns and COVID-19 mortality across 170 countries
- Applied multiple machine learning models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, PCR, and PLS) to identify food categories predictive of COVID-19 death rates
- Conducted data preprocessing, outlier detection, and KNN imputation to handle missing values and ensure model reliability
- Translated model findings into actionable nutritional insights, highlighting dietary factors that may mitigate pandemic-related health risks

A Reinforcement Learning Simulation of Personalized JITAIs in the RECENTRE Project - 4TU-federation
- Designed and simulated a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) system to promote physical activity among individuals with metabolic syndrome
- Implemented a Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm to adapt intervention timing, content, and frequency based on simulated behavioural feedback
- Translated algorithmic findings into eHealth design principles, illustrating how reinforcement learning can optimize personalized behaviour-change strategies before clinical deployment
